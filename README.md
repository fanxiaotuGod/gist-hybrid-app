# Gist Hybrid App - Quick Start Guide

This project is a hybrid application built with Next.js (Web) and Expo (Mobile).

## 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version)
- `npm` (comes with Node.js)

## 2. Installation

Navigate to the project's root directory and install all dependencies for both the web and mobile apps.

```bash
# Install all required packages
npm install
```

## 3. Running the Project

You can run the web and mobile applications simultaneously.

### To Run the Web App (Next.js):

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run web
```

### To Run the Mobile App (Expo):

This will start the Expo development server and display a QR code in your terminal. Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your phone to see the mobile app.

```bash
npm run native
```

You can also press `a` or `i` in the terminal to run it on an Android or iOS simulator if you have one set up.
